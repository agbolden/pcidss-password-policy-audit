üîç Password Policy Validation ‚Äì Interview & Evidence Log

This document simulates a real-world PCI DSS v4.0 password policy audit, structured from the perspective of an Internal Security Assessor (ISA). The ISA does not apply system changes but instead requests that the IT Lead (Stone Cold Steve Austin) demonstrate compliance settings, which are then captured as evidence.
