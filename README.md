# üîê PCI DSS Password Policy Audit Lab (Windows 10 VM)

This lab simulates a real-world internal PCI DSS v4.0.1 audit focused on password policy validation and enforcement.  
As an Internal Security Assessor (ISA), I performed a walkthrough of a Windows 10 virtual machine to validate compliance with Requirement 8.

## üìã Internal PCI DSS Password Policy Audit Report

**Confidential ‚Äì For Internal Use Only**

- **Organization:** Google.com  
- **System Owner:** Stone Cold Steve Austin - IT Lead  
- **Audit Performed By:** Alex Bolden‚Äì Internal PCI Auditor  
- **Audit Date:** June 2025  
- **Target System:** Windows 10 Standalone VM

### Executive Summary

This audit report presents the results of an internal assessment of the password authentication policies configured on a Windows 10 virtual machine used for PCI-related administrative functions.

The goal was to validate compliance with **PCI DSS v4.0.1 Requirement 8**. The assessment revealed multiple deficiencies in system configuration ‚Äî most notably in password length, complexity, expiration, lockout thresholds, and temporary password handling.

---

### System Design Description

The target system is a Windows 10 standalone VM simulating access to cardholder data. It is configured using local security policy (`secpol.msc`) and does not rely on domain-joined group policies. Local user accounts are used to validate enforcement of password and account lockout policies.

System changes are applied manually and validated using PowerShell and command-line tools.

---

### Observations

During the audit, it was noted that several password-related controls were misconfigured. Key observations include:

- Password length set below PCI minimum  
- Complexity settings disabled  
- Expiration and reuse policies misaligned with standards  
- Lockout thresholds too lenient  
- No enforcement for temp password reset  
- No documented configuration standard or user password guidance was provided

### Audit Findings

| Finding # | Description | PCI DSS Requirement | Risk | Recommendation | Due Date |
|-----------|-------------|---------------------|------|----------------|----------|
| 8.01 | Password minimum length is set to 8 characters | 8.3.6 | Susceptible to brute-force attacks | Set password length to 12 characters | 2025-06-20 |
| 8.02 | Password complexity is disabled | 8.3.7 | Allows weak passwords with low entropy | Enable complexity: uppercase, lowercase, number, special character | 2025-06-20 |
| 8.03 | Password expiration set to 180 days | 8.3.8 | Extended expiration increases exposure | Reduce to 90-day expiration per PCI DSS | 2025-06-20 |
| 8.04 | Only 1 password remembered | 8.3.9 | Allows password cycling | Remember last 4 passwords | 2025-06-20 |
| 8.05 | Lockout threshold set to 20 attempts | 8.3.11 | Increased brute-force risk | Lower to 10 failed attempts | 2025-06-20 |
| 8.06 | Lockout duration only 5 minutes | 8.3.12 | Resets too quickly for protection | Set to 30 minutes or manual reset | 2025-06-20 |
| 8.07 | Temporary passwords don‚Äôt expire | 8.3.13 | Long-lived temp access risk | Enforce 24-hour expiry + reset at login | 2025-06-20 |

### Remediation Plan

The System Owner is responsible for applying the above recommendations by **June 20, 2025**.  
Changes can be made via `secpol.msc` or GPO.

A follow-up validation audit will be performed after the deadline. All remediated controls must be evidenced with screenshots and timestamped confirmation.

---

### Conclusion

This internal audit has identified multiple deviations from PCI DSS Requirement 8. A formal remediation effort is required to address the gaps before the system can be marked compliant.

Once changes are implemented, a compliance verification walkthrough will confirm closure of each finding.

## üîç Assessor Interview & Evidence Log

| PCI Req | Interview Question | Screenshot |
|---------|--------------------|------------|
| **8.3.7** | Can you show that users cannot reuse any of their last 4 passwords? | ![](screenshots_post/after_password_history_4.png) |
| **8.3.8** | Where is your documented guidance on password creation, reuse, and reporting? | _(Jira ticket or SharePoint entry pending)_ |
| **8.3.9** | Can you show that passwords are configured to expire every 90 days? | ![](screenshots_post/after_password_age_90_days.png) |
| **8.3.4** | What happens after 10 failed login attempts? And how long is the lockout duration? | ![](screenshots_post/after_lockout_threshold_10.png)<br>![](screenshots_post/after_lockout_duration_30min.png) |
| **8.6.3** | How do you ensure passwords are constructed with complexity appropriate to their usage? | ![](screenshots_post/after_complexity_enabled.png) |

## üñºÔ∏è Screenshot Evidence

Screenshots are split into folders:

- [`screenshots_pre/`](./screenshots_pre) ‚Äì Before remediation  
- [`screenshots_post/`](./screenshots_post) ‚Äì After remediation  

Each screenshot is named after the PCI requirement or system setting being validated. All images are embedded directly above in the Interview Table for visual clarity.

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Remediation Summary

All misconfigurations were remediated by the IT Lead. Screenshots reflect updated policies enforced through `secpol.msc`.

Each remediation aligns directly with the internal audit findings documented earlier in this repo.

---

## ‚úÖ Compliance Conclusion

The target system now meets PCI DSS v4.0.1 Requirement 8 password policy expectations.  
A full remediation walkthrough, interview log, and evidence chain have been provided for validation and audit readiness.
